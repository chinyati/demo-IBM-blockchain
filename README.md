# demo-IBM-blockchain
Demo IBM blockchain implementation using Hyperledger smart contracts.

Created three different smart contract implementations. Instantiating the first, installing a second so as to upgrade and then packaging the third and also upgrading the smart contracts.

Had a Typescript implementation of a web application that can create and query a local blockchain.
